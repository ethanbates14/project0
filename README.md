Description: small 4 page site about me (Ethan Bates)

1) Landing/Home Page 
-- simple picture and welcome message
-- utilizes bootstap4 jumbotron component 
-- media query in CSS modifies the welcome message with screen width changes

2) About Page 
-- quick hits about my current profession, how I got here, and why I enrolled in Harvard Extension School
-- general interests
-- utlilizes some FontAwesome Icons in place of bullets with pseudoclass selectors

3) Education Page
-- quick background of undergraduate and graduate education
-- contains table of relevant coursework taken so far at Harvard
-- experimented with SASS nesting via edu_nesting.css stylesheet

4) Work Page
-- list professional work experience 
-- experimented with SCSS inheritance

Other Notes
-- Bootrap Nav for page links - some brand customization with Google Fonts
-- Heavy on Boostrap4 containers, rows, and cols using grid format
-- Big fan of GoogleFont Lobster Font
-- SASS experimentation can definitely be applied elsewhere, I just had not used it before
-- I know my colors are boring, but I am a database guy, so the default bootstrap themes looks great to me
